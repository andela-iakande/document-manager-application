Document management system is an application that is employed by users to manage their documents in a well structured manner. A User will able to upload a document, edit it and share it with other users. Aside from enabling users to properly document their work with regard to category, the application permits users to work collaboratively on documents.

Document Management System provides a restful API and friend users interface for users to create and manage documents giving different privileges based on user roles and managing authentication using Json Web Token (JWT). The API has routes, each dedicated to a single task that uses HTTP response codes to indicate API status and errors.

#### Limitations:
The limitations to the **Document Management System API** are as follows:
* Users cannot upload documents
* Users cannot share documents with people, but can make document `public` to make it available to other users
* Users login and obtain a token which is verified on every request, but users cannot logout (nullify the token), however tokens become invalid when it expires (after 24 hours)
